# duckdb_demo

A demo of the use of DuckDB to write SQL queries against pandas dataframes.  Note that this is done without formally setting up a database server or even connecting to a db.

## Installation of DuckDB

- Should be done automatically upon creation of codespace but can also be done manually via pip:

    $ pip install duckdb
